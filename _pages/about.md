#### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm <a href='#'>Xiang Li</a>, an M.S. student in Computer Science at the University of Chicago, set to graduate in March 2025. I'm actively seeking opportunities where I can apply my academic knowledge to practical, real-world challenges.<br>


#### My Expertise

My core focus lies in <a href='#'>backend development</a> with a strong foundation in **Java** and the **Spring ecosystem**. I have experience contributing to **enterprise-level projects**. 

With a keen interest in distributed systems and cloud computing, Iâ€™m also expanding my knowledge in AI and big data architecture.<br>


#### Interests and Exploration

In addition to backend development, I have some experience with React.js and Node.js for frontend work, which helps me provide a well-rounded, full-stack perspective. I enjoy learning continuously and documenting my journey through **public projects** and **notes**.
